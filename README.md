# Clerk

Clerk was a good idea, but moving to a service-oriented architecture was more work than we could muster at Kitsu.

We have chosen to abandon it in favor of using and extending Shrine.rb to meet our needs within our Rails monolith.

Hopefully someday service-oriented architecture will become easy even for small companies like us!
